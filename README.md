# xboxdrv-mouse

This will be a repository for a few settings for the xboxdrv driver, as it is used on a Fedora 24 Linux system. The driver's home is here:

* https://github.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv

The driver is used for an Xbox 360 wireless controller (*1*). And with xboxdrv this controller basically was changed into a mouse with more than 20 buttons. Seems to work like a charm so far with very few, it seems, basically neglegible glitches. Currently it is used mainly for running mpv (*2*), the movie player. If you're used to handle joysticks you might even like to use this controller for navigating your desktop. And no: you can't type with it. Not yet ... ;=)

The problem lies with the documentation: I basically got the driver running via trial and error. So hopefully this situation can be changed with a little attention to the docs that already come with the driver itself, and some description of how I got it working.

Enjoy!
