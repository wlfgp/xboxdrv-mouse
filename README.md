# xboxdrv-mouse

This will be a repository for a few settings for the xboxdrv driver, as it is used on Fedora Linux 24. The driver's home is here:

https://github.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv

The driver is used for an Xbox 360 wireless controller. And this controller basically was turned into a mouse with more than 20 buttons with this driver. Seems to work like a charm so far, with very few, it seems, basically neglegible glitches. Currently it is mainly used for running mpv (*1), the movie player.

The problem lies with the documentation: I basically got the driver running via trial and error. So hopefully this situation can be changed with a little attention to the docs that already come with the driver itself, and some description of how I got it working.

Enjoy!
